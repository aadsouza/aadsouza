abstract: The stalling of convergence in racial wage inequality among men and
  the exacerbating Black-white wage gap among women coupled with higher
  de-unionization rates for Black people provokes an inquiry into the effects of
  labor unions on racial inequality. Exploiting variation from recent
  right-to-work legislation, I find evidence that laws that weaken unions
  increase Black-white wage inequality with the effects concentrated at the
  bottom of the wage distribution and among women. In addition to a baseline
  decrease in wages of over 3%, right-to-work laws lead to a disproportionate
  3.88% decline in wages for Black women. These effects are largely driven by
  spillovers which are harshest around the twentieth centile of the wage
  distribution where the associated surplus union premium for Black women is the
  strongest.
